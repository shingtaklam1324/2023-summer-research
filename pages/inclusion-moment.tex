Let \(G\) be a Lie group, acting on \(\mfg^*\) by the coadjoint action. Fix \(\xi \in \mfg^*\), and let \(\mcO = G \cdot \xi\) be its orbit. Recall we have the Kirillov-Kostant symplectic form

\[\omega_\xi(\ad_X^*(\xi), \ad_Y^*(\xi)) = \inner{\xi,[X, Y]}\]

for \(X, Y \in \mfg\). We will show that the inclusion map \(i : \mcO \to \mfg^*\) is a moment map for the action of \(G\) on \(\mcO\). Equivariance is clear since the action is just the restriction of the coadjoint action. 

For \(X \in \mfg\), define a vector field \(X^\#\) by

\[X^\#_\mu = \dv{t}\bigg\vert_{t=0}\Ad_{\exp(tX)}^*\mu\]

and the component of the inclusion map \(i\) is

\[i^X(\mu) = \inner{i(\mu), X} = \inner{\mu, X}\]

We want to show that \(\dd i^X = \iota_{X^\#}\omega\). For \(Y \in \mfg\), \(\mu \in \mcO\), we have that

\begin{align*}
    \dd i^X(Y^\#)(\mu) &= Y_\mu^\#\left(i^X\right) \\
    &= \dv{t}\bigg\vert_{t=0}\left(\Ad_{\exp(tY)}^*\mu\right)i^X \\
    &= \dv{t}\bigg\vert_{t=0}\inner{\Ad_{\exp(tY)}^*\mu, X} \\
    &= \inner{Y_\mu^\#, X}
\end{align*}

\begin{lemma*}
    \[\inner{Y_\mu^\#, X} = \inner{\mu, [X, Y]}\]

    for all \(X, Y \in \mfg\).
\end{lemma*}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{align*}
        \inner{Y_\mu^\#, X} &= \inner{\dv{t}\bigg\vert_{t=0}\Ad_{\exp(tY)}^*\mu, X} \\
        &= \dv{t}\bigg\vert_{t=0}\inner{\xi, \Ad_{\exp(-tY)}X} \\
        &= \inner{\xi, \dv{t}\bigg\vert_{t=0}\Ad_{\exp(-tY)}X} \\
        &= \inner{\xi, [X, Y]}
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

Therefore, we have that

\[\dd i^X(Y^\#)(\mu) = \inner{\mu, [X, Y]}\]

On the other hand, we have that

\[\iota_{X^\#}\omega(Y^\#)(\mu) = \omega_\mu(X^\#, Y^\#) = \inner{\mu, [X, Y]}\]
