\maketitle

Let \(M\) a K\"ahler manifold, \(G\) a compact Lie group acting on \(M\), with

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(G\) acting on \(M\) in a Hamiltonian way, with moment map \(\mu : M \to \mfg^*\),
    \item \(G\) acting on \(M\) isometrically.
    \item \(G\) acting freely on \(\mu^{-1}(0)\).
\end{enumerate}

Then we have that \(\mu^{-1}(0)/G\) is a K\"ahler manifold. Suppose \(G^\C\) is a complexification of \(G\).
